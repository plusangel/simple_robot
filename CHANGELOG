0.0.1 simple_robot
Initial commit

0.0.2 simple_robot
Twist_To_Motors interface implemented by applying differential drive classic
equations.
moveMotors plugin changed from Int to Float to simplify the control (standrd
input from the keypboard)

0.0.3 simple_robot
Odometry plugin added

0.0.4 simple_robot
First cut of encoders added to the simulation

0.0.5 simple_robot
Encoders have their own message type (like in hardware interface) and publish to
the dedicated topic, as they should.

0.0.6 simple_robot
This update includes the followings:
- motors listen to joint velocities in an Int16MultiArray
- description.launch added to easily create model in other launch files
- motors support offset in sides to simulate real low-quality amplifiers/motors
- odometry updated to publish pose as well
- mock_velocities updated to publish joint velocities

0.0.7 simple_robot
This update includes the followings:
- A normal distribution added to tick counts
- Resolution added to encoder ticks for the motors
- A clean xacro with color updates

0.0.8 simple_robot
In this update, we change the joint_velocities topics message from Int16MultiArray
to Float32MultiArray

0.0.9 simple_robot
Bugfix the correct side application of the transmitted joint velocities to the robot

0.0.10 simple_robot
First cut of the simple control framework added

0.0.11 simple_robot
The control framework debugged and introduced as part of the simple_robot_control

0.0.12 simple_robot
The twist_to_motors manual controller updated to support the new joint_velocities
approach.

0.0.13 simple_robot
Odom gazebo plugin refactored to support 4-wheels drive

0.2.0 simple_robot
In this update we introduced the following:
- The problem with the custom messages included in the build before created is fixed.
- Added a new configuration for a 4wheels robot

0.2.1 simple_robot
In this update we have further tidied up the 2wheels and 4wheels models

0.2.2 simple_robot
In this update we introduce meshes in gazebo models instead of shape

0.2.3 simple_robot
In this update we upgrated the move_wheels plugin to support 2wheels and 4wheels

0.2.4 simple_robot
In this update we completed the upgrade of the encoders plugin to support 4 wheels
and we increase the friction coefficients of the wheels to avoid slipage

0.2.5 simple_robot
In this update we upgraded the simple controller to support 2 and 4 wheels. Additionally,
we debugged the 4wheels robot (base_footprint)
